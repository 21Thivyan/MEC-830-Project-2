MEC-830-Project-2: Inverted Pendulum System
Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing a self-balancing inverted pendulum system using components from the ELEGOO Starter Kit. The system stabilizes the pendulum under disturbances, integrates sensors and actuators, and utilizes Arduino for control.

Key Features
Mechanical Design: Pendulum length (40–50 cm) and mass (50–100 g), built with commonly available materials.
Control: Arduino-based controller using PID and other control strategies.
Sensors and Actuators: ELEGOO kit components for motion tracking and stabilization.
